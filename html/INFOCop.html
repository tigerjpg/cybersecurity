<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Concept Of Operations</strong></u></p>

<p>TIGER products are delivered within 2 business day of purchase. TIGER&#39;s Technicians come to the customer, take control of all the hardware necessary to install the purchased products. Upon installation, the company will provide the services promised in timely matter. The company will run a test to see if the software is working as intended. In case of a fail in the test, TIGER will fix the issue without any additional cost, just as in the policy. TIGER installs the systems within 48 hours. It requires that the costumer provides all the current security details of the server. Nothing will be changed, instead, more security features will be installed on top of the current. Tiger keeps a data base of employees and contacts them every quarter to see if the systems are up to date, or to discuss contract clauses.</p>
